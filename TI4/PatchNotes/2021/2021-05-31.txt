v38
- Fix gamedata bug when the map tool has an invalid map string (still reports the problem once, but ignores it after that).
- Fix gamedata bug that can happen with an empty map ("attempt to compare two nil values").
- Added "Munitions Reserves" card to the tools bag, Letnev players may place it in their play area to automate their faction ability.
